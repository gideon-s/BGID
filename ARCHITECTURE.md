# BGID Architecture

A hybrid, browser-based MUD: multiple players sharing a persistent world,
with LLM-driven (DeepSeek) NPCs that respond in character.

This document describes the target architecture and the incremental plan to
get there. It is a living document — update it as the design evolves.

## Goals & constraints

- **Browser clients** are the primary target → WebSockets for live gameplay.
- **LLM NPCs** take 2–5s to respond → NPC turns must be async and pushed, never
  blocking a connection or a request.
- **Hobby scale** (tens to low-hundreds of concurrent players) → a single
  FastAPI process with an in-memory world + asyncio is sufficient. Keep the
  pub/sub behind an interface so a Redis backend can slot in later if needed.

## Transport decision: WebSockets (for gameplay)

A MUD's defining requirement is **server-pushed, room-scoped events**: a player
must learn about others' actions in their room without polling. That needs a
persistent push channel. For browser clients, WebSockets is the conventional
and correct choice, and the project already has the connection primitive
(`websocket_manager.py`).

Raw TCP (telnet) would suit a terminal MUD; SSE+POST is a viable simpler
alternative if we ever drop bidirectional needs. Neither is the target today.

## REST vs. realtime split

**Rule of thumb:** if it changes the shared world or must notify others → WS.
If it's a player or admin managing data → REST.

| Concern | Channel |
| --- | --- |
| Join world, `look`, `move`, `say`, `talk` (NPC), `attack`, `take`/`drop` | **WebSocket** |
| Player/Room/NPC/Item CRUD, content authoring, seeding, character sheets, health | **REST** (existing) |
| Initial room snapshot on connect | WS, sent immediately after the socket opens |

We deliberately avoid full REST/WS parity: duplicated surface is duplicated
bugs. REST stays for setup/admin/CRUD (and powers `admin.py`); all live
gameplay flows over the socket.

```

- **WorldState** *(new — `world.py`)*: the live source of truth for who/what is
  where. The DB is for persistence and recovery, not live reads. Structural
  data (rooms, NPCs, items) is cached at load; player presence is tracked live;
  `reload()` resyncs after admin edits.
- **ConnectionManager** *(have — `websocket_manager.py`)*: socket registry, room
  subscriptions, `broadcast_to_room`, personal messages. Already capable.
- **CommandDispatcher** *(new)*: parses inbound WS messages and routes to
  handlers that mutate `WorldState` and emit events.
- **NPCTurnManager** *(new, wraps existing LLM path)*: runs the DeepSeek call as
  an async task and pushes the result into the room. Reuses
  `deepseek_integration` + `BaseLLMNPC`.
- **Game loop / tick** *(later)*: optional asyncio task for NPC wandering,
  combat rounds, regen, timed events.

The existing in-memory `ChatManager` (global/room/private routing) overlaps with
room-scoped broadcast; its routing idea folds into the dispatcher/world.

## Async NPC turn (the headline mechanic)

```
player → {"cmd":"talk","npc_id":1,"text":"who are you?"}
  dispatcher: ack + broadcast {"event":"npc_thinking","npc_id":1} to room
  asyncio.create_task(deepseek_call)          # non-blocking
  on done: broadcast {"event":"npc_said","npc_id":1,"text":"..."} to room
```

No socket blocks while an NPC "thinks"; other players keep acting; the
"Caretaker is thinking…" beat is good MUD texture.

## Message protocol (initial)

Client → server:

```json
{"cmd":"look"}
{"cmd":"move","dir":"north"}
{"cmd":"say","text":"hello"}
{"cmd":"talk","npc_id":1,"text":"who are you?"}
{"cmd":"attack","npc_id":3}
```

Server → client:

```json
{"event":"room_state","room":{...},"players":[...],"npcs":[...],"items":[...]}
{"event":"chat","from":"Bryan","text":"hello"}
{"event":"npc_thinking","npc_id":1}
{"event":"npc_said","npc_id":1,"name":"Caretaker","text":"..."}
{"event":"player_entered","player_id":2,"name":"Aria"}
{"event":"player_left","player_id":2,"name":"Aria"}
{"event":"error","detail":"..."}
```

### Tile protocol (Phase 1 — replaces the in-room movement messages)

The single-room tiled view uses a hard-cutover protocol (closed alpha, no
back-compat). `room_state` → `zone_state`; `move {dir}` → `move {dx,dy}`:

```json
// client → server
{"cmd":"move","dx":1,"dy":0}        // one tile step, orthogonal or diagonal (bump = attack)
{"cmd":"attack","target_id":13}     // explicit adjacent melee
{"cmd":"talk","npc_id":1,"text":"…"}// unchanged (Layer 2)
{"cmd":"say","text":"…"}            // unchanged
{"cmd":"look"}                      // resends zone_state
{"cmd":"map"}                       // request the zone-graph (Phase 2)
{"cmd":"inventory"}                 // request the inventory (Phase 3)
{"cmd":"pickup","item_id":5}        // item_id optional → item on your tile
{"cmd":"drop","item_id":5}          // onto your tile
{"cmd":"equip","item_id":5}         // / {"cmd":"unequip","item_id":5}
{"cmd":"spells"}                    // request the spellbook (Phase 4)
{"cmd":"cast","spell_id":"firebolt","x":9,"y":6}  // x/y omitted for self spells
{"cmd":"sheet"}                     // request the character sheet

// server → client

 "slots":["head","torso","upper_arms","lower_arms","hands","pelvis","upper_legs","lower_legs","feet"]}
// Phase 5: portraits. zone_state.you + each entity + character_sheet carry a
// nullable portrait_url; a `portrait` event announces a just-generated image so
// open windows swap the glyph placeholder live.
{"event":"portrait","kind":"npc","id":3,"url":"/static/portraits/ab12cd34ef567890.png"}
```

**Portraits (Phase 5, Layer 2).** `novita_integration.py` mirrors
`deepseek_integration.py` (config from env, async client, graceful "not
configured" path) but talks to Novita's text-to-image HTTP API with `httpx`
(POST `/v3/async/txt2img` → poll `/v3/async/task-result` → download `image_url`).
Models are **per-purpose** via `portraits.STYLES` (each purpose → model + image
size + prompt suffix; swap via `.env`, no code change): `portrait` uses
**ZavyChromaXL** at 1024² (painterly fantasy busts); `token` uses **SDXL Unstable
Diffusers** at 768² for **overhead map tokens** (top-down) — players + NPCs +
items each get a generate-once token (`token_url` on Npc/Player/Item), rendered
circular-clipped on the tile in place of the emoji glyph (emoji fallback). The
generic seam is `portraits.ensure_image(purpose, kind, subject_id)` (kind ∈
npc/player/item) with `ensure_portrait`/`ensure_token` wrappers; a `token` WS
event + `token_url` snapshot fields mirror the `portrait` ones.
`portraits.py` is a **generate-once store**: a prompt is hashed
(`sha256(prompt)[:16]`), the PNG is written to `static/portraits/{hash}.png`
(served by the `/static` mount, gitignored), and a nullable `portrait_url` is
persisted on `Player` + `Npc`. An in-memory in-flight set + a
`PORTRAIT_MAX_CONCURRENT` semaphore bound calls; identical prompts dedup to one
file, so **N subjects = N API calls ever**. `ensure_portrait` is fire-and-forget
(returns the url if known / adopts an existing file / else spawns an async job →
writes file → sets `portrait_url` → broadcasts `portrait`), triggered on connect,
zone entry, first `talk`, and first `sheet`. The player prompt folds in the
free-form `appearance` field, so editing it (`set_appearance`) re-keys the hash
and a fresh portrait generates. Dark by default: with no
`NOVITA_API_KEY` the manager is disabled and every subject falls back to its
emoji glyph (exactly how DeepSeek-off degrades). Additive `migrate_phase5.py`.

**PvP:** bumping another player (or `attack {target_id}` on one) strikes them —
`world.try_step` returns `ATTACK target_kind:"player"`, `combat.resolve_pvp_attack`
rolls with both sides' gear and routes a kill through the shared `damage_player`
(broadcast + respawn + grace). **Pickups skip immovable items** (`world.grabbable_at`)
so an item resting on a chest/furniture stays retrievable.

**Class-gear chest:** an immovable `item_type:"chest"` item (the Old Chest in the
Great Hall) grants the **opener's class starting kit** (`classes.starting_gear`)
on the `open` WS command (**O** key when on/adjacent) — created in the pack and
auto-equipped — **once per character** (`Player.opened_chests` JSON, set by
`ItemService.open_chest`; `migrate_chest.py`).

Equipment slots: `weapon`, `ring`×2, `amulet`, and the **15 body slots** —
`head`/`torso`/`pelvis` plus independent left/right for each limb
(`{left,right}_upper_arm`/`_lower_arm`/`_hand`/`_upper_leg`/`_lower_leg`/`_foot`)
— driving the character-sheet paperdoll. `Player` carries `char_class`/`mana`/
`race` (`races.py`, a small ability nudge)/`gender`/`skills` (a JSON `{skill:
rank}` dict from `skills.py`)/`appearance` (free-form looks/bio, set at creation
and editable from the sheet via the `set_appearance` WS cmd; it feeds the
portrait prompt, so editing it clears `portrait_url` and regenerates). Character **creation is its own gate screen** (not
the character-select list). Legacy single limb slots migrate to their left side.

## Graphical overhaul — two-tier tiled world (Phase 1)

BGID is being reshaped into an **overhead, real-time roguelike** while keeping
the LLM social layer. Two tiers share one world view (see
`docs/handoff-01-graphical-overhaul-master.md`):

- **Layer 1 — the dungeon (no LLM):** each room is now an overhead **tile grid**
  (`Room.width/height/tiles/spawn_x/spawn_y`; glyphs `#` wall, `.` floor, `+`
  door). `WorldState` tracks live tile positions (`RoomNode.player_pos` /
  `npc_pos`) and resolves all movement through one helper, `try_step` →
  `MOVED | BLOCKED | ATTACK` (bump-to-attack). Melee is adjacency-gated and
  single-strike. A **fast combat tick** (`game_loop._combat_loop`,
  `COMBAT_TICK_SECONDS≈0.3`, separate from the 15s regen tick) drives hostile
  mob AI: acquire nearest player in `aggro_radius`, `step_toward`, melee when
  adjacent. The hot tick is **DB-free for movement** (positions in memory).
- **Layer 2 — the story (LLM):** unchanged `talk`/`npc_said`, plus a throttled
  **smack-talk bridge** (`smack_talk.py`): Layer-1 combat events fan out to short
  in-character barbs, gated by a per-mob cooldown + a per-room global budget
  (`rate_limit.check_mob_chatter`), with a **canned-barb fallback** so combat
  stays playable and free when DeepSeek is off/throttled.

**Client** (`static/index.html` + vendored `static/vendor/rot.min.js`,
`rough.min.js`): the tile world renders as a **hand-drawn ink-on-graph-paper
dungeon map** (Phase 6 — `rough.js` sketchy cross-hatched walls, ink room
outline, arc doorways, compass rose; the static map is cached to an offscreen
layer so spell-FX frames don't re-randomise). `ROT.FOV.PreciseShadowcasting`
still drives fog-of-war (visible = full ink, remembered = faded). Entities/items
are emoji **tokens** on paper discs, animated by a `requestAnimationFrame` loop
(`paint()` blits the cached map; `draw()` owns FOV + the cache): eased movement
slides, floating combat numbers, hit-flash, attacker lunge, and death fade — the
loop runs only while something is animating. The **M** overview redraws as a `map.jpg`-
style floor plan (numbered chambers, locked exits, cartouche, compass). A Layer-2
dialogue window (right) and combat-log/stats strip complete the layout. Movement
is WASD/arrow keys; bump a foe to attack. (Renderer evolved: Phase 1 used rot.js
`Display` with emoji tiles → a custom dark-vellum 2D-canvas → the Phase-6
cartographic look; rot.js is kept only for FOV math.)

Phase 1 is scoped to a **single tiled room** (no zone-to-zone door transitions —
that's Phase 2). The room-graph (`RoomExit`, `directions.py`) and the REST
`/action` movement remain intact underneath for Phase 2 to build on.

## Persistence strategy

- Load full world from DB at startup.
- **Write-through** on durable mutations (player room changes, health, items).
- Ephemeral state (who is online, "thinking" flags, transient combat timers)
  lives only in memory.
- On clean shutdown, optionally flush. Crash recovery = reload from DB; online
  presence is naturally rebuilt as clients reconnect.

## Scale notes

Single process + asyncio + in-memory `WorldState` + WS handles the target load.
`broadcast_to_room` is the seam: keep it an interface so a Redis pub/sub backend
can replace the in-process version for multi-worker deployments — but only if
that day comes. Do not build it now.

## Incremental build plan

Each step keeps the app runnable.

1. ✅ **WorldState** (`world.py`) — load rooms/NPCs/items/player-locations from
   DB at startup; room snapshots; player presence; `move_player` write-through.
2. ✅ **Real `/ws` handler** — on connect, join the world and send `room_state`;
   `look` / `move` / `say` with room broadcast; presence enter/leave.
3. ✅ **NPC turns** (`npc_turns.py`) — `talk` runs the DeepSeek call as a
   fire-and-forget task and broadcasts `npc_thinking` / `npc_said` room-wide.
4. ✅ **Combat & tick** (`combat.py`, `game_loop.py`) — `attack` (turn-based,
   death/respawn, room-wide) and a periodic NPC-regen tick.

5. ✅ **Room graph** (`models.RoomExit`, `directions.py`) — directed exits with
   locks/keys; direction-based, lock-aware movement (WS + `/action`); exits in
   room_state/`/state`; exit-management API. **Consumable shared unlock:** using
   a key to pass a locked door **destroys the key** (`ItemService.destroy`) and
   opens the door for *everyone* for `DOOR_UNLOCK_SECONDS` (a single in-memory
   timer, `world.door_unlocks`); the slow tick (`_relock_doors`) re-locks it and
   respawns the key at its recorded home tile (`world.key_home`, armed at load).
   A restart reverts an open door to locked (timers aren't persisted) and recovers
   a mid-crumble key to its home (`world._arm_doors`).

6. ✅ **Tiled combat slice** (graphical overhaul Phase 1) — rooms become overhead
   tile grids; per-tile movement + FOV; bump-to-attack melee; a real-time mob-AI
   combat tick (aggro/path/melee); LLM smack-talk with canned fallback; rot.js
   three-region client. Single room only — zones/doors are Phase 2. See
   `docs/handoff-02-phase1-tiled-combat-slice.md`.

7. ✅ **Zones & the map** (Phase 2) — stepping onto a border door (cardinal) or
   stairs (`>`/`<`, up/down) transitions between tiled zones, resolved against
   the existing room-graph exits (`world.transition_for_tile`/`arrival_tile`)
   with lock/key enforcement; all seeded rooms tiled; per-zone explored memory +
   a current-zone minimap; an on-demand overview map (`map` command → `world_map`
   event; zone graph with visited rooms + locked exits). See
   `docs/handoff-03-phase2-zones-and-map.md`.

8. ✅ **Inventory & equipment** (Phase 3) — items gained tile positions (ground
   items ride `zone_state.items` and render on the map); pickup (**G** / `get`)
   and drop onto tiles; equip slots (weapon, armor, ring ×2, amulet) with
   per-slot limits (`services.SLOT_LIMITS`, equipping a full slot swaps the
   oldest); item `attack_bonus`/`defense_bonus`/`damage_bonus` feed the D20
   resolver via `ItemService.equipment_bonuses` (the single seam combat reads);
   inventory overlay (**I**) + worn summary. New `items` columns (additive
   migration, `migrate_phase3.py`); the Cellar is re-locked behind the now-
   grabbable Rusty Key. See `docs/handoff-04-phase3-inventory-equipment.md`.

9. ✅ **Classes, spells & mana** (Phase 4) — characters pick a **class**
   (Warrior/Mage/Cleric/Rogue + a `wanderer` migration fallback) at creation,
   stamping abilities/glyph/mana from `classes.py`. A data-driven spell registry
   (`spells.py`) with mana cost + per-`(player,spell)` cooldown; `cast` resolves
   `self`/`bolt`/`blast` via new `world.line_of_sight` (Bresenham,
   `SIGHT_BLOCKING`) + `world.tiles_in_radius` — the first **ranged & AoE** on
   the grid. Spells auto-hit (range/LOS is the counterplay) and reuse the shared
   `combat.damage_npc`/`damage_player` death/respawn paths. Mana regenerates on
   the regen tick per class. New `players` columns (`char_class`/`mana`/
   `max_mana`, additive `migrate_phase4.py`); client mana bar, quickslot bar
   (keys 1–9), click-to-target, `spell_cast` VFX, class picker.
   See `docs/handoff-05-phase4-classes-spells-mana.md`.

### Future
- Per-NPC conversation memory across `talk` turns.
- Richer combat (initiative, abilities, NpcReaction-driven aggro) and a real
  NPC AI tick (wandering, hostiles engaging on sight).

### Out of scope here (tracked separately)
- Reactions endpoint (`/npcs/{id}/reaction/...`) the CLIs expect (P1).
- `pytest-asyncio` test harness (P1).
- Config/seed cleanup, committed cruft (P2).
