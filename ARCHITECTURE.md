# BGID Architecture

A hybrid, browser-based MUD: multiple players sharing a persistent world,
with LLM-driven (DeepSeek) NPCs that respond in character.

This document describes the target architecture and the incremental plan to
get there. It is a living document — update it as the design evolves.

## Goals & constraints

- **Browser clients** are the primary target → WebSockets for live gameplay.
- **LLM NPCs** take 2–5s to respond → NPC turns must be async and pushed, never
  blocking a connection or a request.
- **Hobby scale** (tens to low-hundreds of concurrent players) → a single
  FastAPI process with an in-memory world + asyncio is sufficient. Keep the
  pub/sub behind an interface so a Redis backend can slot in later if needed.

## Transport decision: WebSockets (for gameplay)

A MUD's defining requirement is **server-pushed, room-scoped events**: a player
must learn about others' actions in their room without polling. That needs a
persistent push channel. For browser clients, WebSockets is the conventional
and correct choice, and the project already has the connection primitive
(`websocket_manager.py`).

Raw TCP (telnet) would suit a terminal MUD; SSE+POST is a viable simpler
alternative if we ever drop bidirectional needs. Neither is the target today.

## REST vs. realtime split

**Rule of thumb:** if it changes the shared world or must notify others → WS.
If it's a player or admin managing data → REST.

| Concern | Channel |
| --- | --- |
| Join world, `look`, `move`, `say`, `talk` (NPC), `attack`, `take`/`drop` | **WebSocket** |
| Player/Room/NPC/Item CRUD, content authoring, seeding, character sheets, health | **REST** (existing) |
| Initial room snapshot on connect | WS, sent immediately after the socket opens |

We deliberately avoid full REST/WS parity: duplicated surface is duplicated
bugs. REST stays for setup/admin/CRUD (and powers `admin.py`); all live
gameplay flows over the socket.

```

- **WorldState** *(new — `world.py`)*: the live source of truth for who/what is
  where. The DB is for persistence and recovery, not live reads. Structural
  data (rooms, NPCs, items) is cached at load; player presence is tracked live;
  `reload()` resyncs after admin edits.
- **ConnectionManager** *(have — `websocket_manager.py`)*: socket registry, room
  subscriptions, `broadcast_to_room`, personal messages. Already capable.
- **CommandDispatcher** *(new)*: parses inbound WS messages and routes to
  handlers that mutate `WorldState` and emit events.
- **NPCTurnManager** *(new, wraps existing LLM path)*: runs the DeepSeek call as
  an async task and pushes the result into the room. Reuses
  `deepseek_integration` + `BaseLLMNPC`.
- **Game loop / tick** *(later)*: optional asyncio task for NPC wandering,
  combat rounds, regen, timed events.

The existing in-memory `ChatManager` (global/room/private routing) overlaps with
room-scoped broadcast; its routing idea folds into the dispatcher/world.

## Async NPC turn (the headline mechanic)

```
player → {"cmd":"talk","npc_id":1,"text":"who are you?"}
  dispatcher: ack + broadcast {"event":"npc_thinking","npc_id":1} to room
  asyncio.create_task(deepseek_call)          # non-blocking
  on done: broadcast {"event":"npc_said","npc_id":1,"text":"..."} to room
```

No socket blocks while an NPC "thinks"; other players keep acting; the
"Caretaker is thinking…" beat is good MUD texture.

## Message protocol (initial)

Client → server:

```json
{"cmd":"look"}
{"cmd":"move","dir":"north"}
{"cmd":"say","text":"hello"}
{"cmd":"talk","npc_id":1,"text":"who are you?"}
{"cmd":"attack","npc_id":3}
```

Server → client:

```json
{"event":"room_state","room":{...},"players":[...],"npcs":[...],"items":[...]}
{"event":"chat","from":"Bryan","text":"hello"}
{"event":"npc_thinking","npc_id":1}
{"event":"npc_said","npc_id":1,"name":"Caretaker","text":"..."}
{"event":"player_entered","player_id":2,"name":"Aria"}
{"event":"player_left","player_id":2,"name":"Aria"}
{"event":"error","detail":"..."}
```

## Persistence strategy

- Load full world from DB at startup.
- **Write-through** on durable mutations (player room changes, health, items).
- Ephemeral state (who is online, "thinking" flags, transient combat timers)
  lives only in memory.
- On clean shutdown, optionally flush. Crash recovery = reload from DB; online
  presence is naturally rebuilt as clients reconnect.

## Scale notes

Single process + asyncio + in-memory `WorldState` + WS handles the target load.
`broadcast_to_room` is the seam: keep it an interface so a Redis pub/sub backend
can replace the in-process version for multi-worker deployments — but only if
that day comes. Do not build it now.

## Incremental build plan

Each step keeps the app runnable.

1. ✅ **WorldState** (`world.py`) — load rooms/NPCs/items/player-locations from
   DB at startup; room snapshots; player presence; `move_player` write-through.
2. ✅ **Real `/ws` handler** — on connect, join the world and send `room_state`;
   `look` / `move` / `say` with room broadcast; presence enter/leave.
3. ✅ **NPC turns** (`npc_turns.py`) — `talk` runs the DeepSeek call as a
   fire-and-forget task and broadcasts `npc_thinking` / `npc_said` room-wide.
4. ✅ **Combat & tick** (`combat.py`, `game_loop.py`) — `attack` (turn-based,
   death/respawn, room-wide) and a periodic NPC-regen tick.

5. ✅ **Room graph** (`models.RoomExit`, `directions.py`) — directed exits with
   locks/keys; direction-based, lock-aware movement (WS + `/action`); exits in
   room_state/`/state`; exit-management API.

### Future
- Per-NPC conversation memory across `talk` turns.
- Richer combat (initiative, abilities, NpcReaction-driven aggro) and a real
  NPC AI tick (wandering, hostiles engaging on sight).

### Out of scope here (tracked separately)
- Reactions endpoint (`/npcs/{id}/reaction/...`) the CLIs expect (P1).
- `pytest-asyncio` test harness (P1).
- Config/seed cleanup, committed cruft (P2).
